### Open-source alternative to Linear, Jira, Trello, and Plane, with AI agents built in

Self-hosted project management and issue tracking. The difference: AI agents work here like any
teammate — and everything is available over the REST API, webhooks, and MCP.

If It's a Plan looks useful to you, star the repo ⭐ — it helps other people find it.

## About

It's a Plan is a full issue tracker on its own: projects, boards, cycles, custom fields,
and dashboards. Use it that way and never turn on a single agent.

**The difference: AI agents work here like any teammate.** An agent gets a role,
permissions, and an assignee slot, and takes issues on the same board as your people.

It fits any kind of work: software development, marketing, design, support, sales,
operations, research. You run all of it on your own server, on your own database, with your
own API keys — no per-seat fees, no lock-in.

It's a Plan is under active development. Expect breaking changes before the first stable
release.

## How to help

1. **Star the repo** if you think more people should see it. That is the whole cost, and it
   is what makes the project findable.
2. **Share it** — post it on social media or send it to a colleague who runs a team or
   writes code. One link reaches people search never will.
3. **Contribute.** Issues, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome — start with
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
4. **Donate.** Any amount helps the project grow and keeps the work going. A donation can
   also move a feature up the roadmap — ask on [Telegram](https://telegram.me/croffasia).

## Features

| Area | What you get |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product management | Kanban, table, timeline, and calendar views · cycles · custom fields · dashboards · docs · notes boards |
| AI agents | Agents as project members · internal on any model, or external on your coding CLI · runs start on an @mention, an assignment, or a schedule |
| Platform | REST API with OpenAPI · MCP server · webhooks · pull requests from 5 forges · passkeys and Google sign-in · 6 languages |

<details>
<summary><b>Product management</b> — the full list</summary>

- Configure issues per project: custom fields, labels, states, and issue types
- Kanban, table, timeline, and calendar views. Save each one as a tab with its own filters,
  display fields, and two-level grouping
- Cycles that time-box the work. Unfinished issues move to the next cycle
- Subtasks, checklists, attachments, and links between issues: blocks, relates, duplicates
- Comment threads with replies, and @username mentions of people and agents
- Configurable dashboards for project analytics: throughput, breakdown, pulse
- Quick actions that run on an issue, and auto-assignment when an issue moves into a state
- Docs: shared Markdown pages in a tree, with revision history, private and locked pages,
  favorites, embedded files, and links to the issues they describe
- Freeform notes boards: sticky notes on a canvas, with colors, checklists, and connections
- Share a view or an issue by public link, read-only and without sign-in
- Initiatives that group and track related work inside a project
- Auto-archive, a notification inbox, role-based access control, and more

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>AI agents</b> — the full list</summary>

- Agents as project members, with their own permissions and assigned issues
- Internal agents run on the instance. Configure the model, system prompt, tools, and
  reusable skills, written inline or imported from a GitHub repository
- External agents run on your own machine, under your own account. Install
  [`@itsaplan/runner`](packages/runner) and it gives every task to Claude Code, Codex,
  Antigravity CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, opencode, or any command that reads stdin
- Or control the run queue through the API and do the work in your own implementation
- A run starts on an @mention in a comment, on an assignment, or on a schedule
- Tools for the services outside the tracker: Notion, Telegram, Threads, Instagram, Jina,
  Firecrawl, and Gitea
- Built-in chat with each agent, with its own conversation history
- Chat with an external agent too. The runner answers from your machine, streams the reply
  and its tool calls, and resumes the same coding agent session on each message

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Platform</b> — the full list</summary>

- REST API with an OpenAPI reference and API keys
- MCP server, so an external assistant can read and change issues through the same API
- Pull requests from GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Forgejo, and Bitbucket. "Fixes KEY-42" links the
  pull request to the issue, and the issue moves when the pull request opens and merges
- Outgoing webhooks: subscribe to events, signed payloads, and retries with a delivery log
- Sign in with an email or a username and a password, a passkey, or Google
- Notifications by email (SMTP or Resend) and Telegram, with per-member preferences
- Interface in English, Ukrainian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Arabic, and French
- Instance administration: storage limits, mail transport, and instance-wide settings

## Getting started

### Deploy on Railway — recommended

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/its-a-plan?referralCode=lQ5O6i&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=button&utm_campaign=itsaplan)

The whole stack in one click, with no server to maintain. You give Railway two hostnames,
and it generates every secret. You need a domain of your own: [the guide](docs/railway.md)
explains why, and what to do after the deploy.

### Try it on your machine

Requirements: Docker and [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/croffasia/itsaplan.git
cd itsaplan
bun install
bun run setup   # answer "Try it"
```

It picks free ports, generates the secrets, starts the whole stack in Docker, and opens
<http://localhost:3001>. Everything runs on localhost, so no domain and no reverse proxy are
needed. Run it again later to restart the instance; the data stays.

### Everything else

- [Deploy on Railway](docs/railway.md) — one-click hosted deploy from the template
- [Self-hosting](docs/self-hosting.md) — the full production setup, secrets, and updates
- [Deploy on Coolify](docs/coolify.md) — the same stack on a Coolify instance
- [Deploy on Kubernetes](docs/helm.md) — Helm chart for any Kubernetes cluster
- [Local development](docs/development.md) — running the apps on the host, and the tests
- [Coding agent setup](docs/runner.md) — the config for each CLI that `@itsaplan/runner` runs
- [Breaking changes](docs/breaking-changes.md) — the API paths a release removed, and what replaced them
