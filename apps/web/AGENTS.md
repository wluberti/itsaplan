# web (Next.js) — rules

Next.js App Router, SSR (not SPA). Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui. See root `AGENTS.md`.

## Imports

- A feature is a self-contained module: imports **within the same feature** use relative paths
  (`./`, `../`); imports of the **shared layer or another feature** use the `@/` alias.
- A feature imports the shared layer (`@/utils`, `@/lib`, `@/hooks`, `@/context`, `@/services`,
  `@/components/*`), never another feature —
  one accepted one-way exception: `work-items` may compose `issue` presentational components. Keep it
  one-directional, no cycles; if a second such need appears, move the shared piece to
  `components/common`.
- The shared layer never imports a feature. `app/` routes stay thin: mount the feature page and
  providers only.
- **`@/cloud` is the seam for the hosted edition.** It resolves to `src/ce/index.ts`, which
  exports what a self-hosted instance runs — a screen it does not sell renders nothing. A
  cloud-only component is imported from there and nowhere else. The hosted build points
  `CLOUD_UI_ENTRY` at its own module exporting the same names, and `WEB_TRACING_ROOT` at the
  root its workspace has; unset, both are what this repository needs.

## Feature structure & decomposition

- **One component per file — no exceptions.** A file exports exactly one component, even when the
  extra one is three lines long. On finding a file with two, split it: each component moves to its
  own file named after it, and the imports are updated.
- Keep components small and single-purpose. Split when one grows past ~120 lines or mixes concerns
  (layout + fetch + mutation + dialog). The entry component becomes a thin composition; each part
  is its own file. Push state to where it is used; the parent holds only what it coordinates.
- A feature's own parts go in purpose folders: `components/`, `hooks/`, `context/`, `services/`,
  `utils/`. Split by purpose even when a folder holds one file. A React context and its `use*`
  reader go in `context/`, not `hooks/`. The feature root holds only the entry
  component (named after the feature) — no `pages/` folder (routing is `src/app/`).
- **A feature with more than two pages groups its components by page.** `components/` gets one
  subfolder per page, named after that page (`components/profile/`, `components/security/`), and
  each page's parts go in its own folder. A component used by two or more of the feature's pages
  stays directly in `components/`. A feature with one or two pages keeps `components/` flat.
- Types live next to the code that produces them (API-response type in its service, prop type in
  its component), not in a `types/` folder. Add a `types/` file only for a standalone shape shared
  by several modules with no single owner.
- Shared vs local decides feature-folder vs `src/`: a part used by more than one feature goes to
  the shared layer (`src/utils`, `src/lib`, `src/hooks`, `src/context`, `src/services`,
  `components/{common,ui}`); a part used by one feature stays in it. Promote only when a second
  feature needs it (YAGNI) — don't pre-share.
- The shared layer splits by what a module depends on: `src/lib` holds wrappers over external
  packages (`api.ts`, `auth-client.ts`, `markdown.ts`, `dnd.ts`) plus shadcn's `utils.ts` (`cn`,
  fixed by `components.json`); `src/utils` holds own helpers and constants with no external
  package behind them. `src/context` holds shared React contexts and their `use*` readers.
- `components/common` groups by purpose: `agent-chat/`, `attachments/`, `chart/`, `editor/`,
  `fields/`, `hotkeys/`, `inputs/`, `overlay/`, `page/`, `permissions/`, `share/`, `skeleton/`,
  `timeline/`. A component that fits none of them stays at the `common/` root.
  Imports of a sibling in the same folder are relative; everything else uses `@/`.
- Component files use the feature name as a PascalCase prefix, file name = exported name. Service
  files carry a `.service.ts` suffix (`passkeys.service.ts`). Other non-component files use plain
  descriptive names (the folder gives the context).

## Translations

next-intl, language from the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie — no `[locale]` route segment.
`messages/<locale>/<namespace>.json`, one file per namespace, namespaces are domains
(`issue`, `settings`) not pages.

- English is the source: `src/i18n/messages.ts` imports it statically, merges the chosen
  language over it, and types every `t('…')`. A new key goes there first or typecheck fails;
  an untranslated one renders its English text.
- A new namespace needs its file in every language plus an entry in `defaultMessages`.
- A new language: `messages/<code>/`, `src/i18n/locales.ts`, `src/hooks/useDateFnsLocale.ts`,
  and `LOCALES`/`Locale` in `apps/api/src/modules/user-preferences/`. No migration — the `locale`
  column has no CHECK. One written right to left also goes in `RTL_LOCALES`.
- Don't subset messages per route with `pick()`: a missing namespace then fails at runtime
  instead of at typecheck.
- The layout mirrors for a right-to-left language, so position new components with the logical
  utilities — `ms`/`me`, `ps`/`pe`, `start`/`end`, `border-s`/`border-e`, `text-start`/`text-end`
  — not `ml-`, `left-` or `text-left`, which compile to physical CSS and ignore `dir`. A
  `left`/`translate-x` centring pair and an edge the caller names (`Sheet side="right"`) stay
  physical; content that is not prose (timelines, charts, code) sits in a `dir="ltr"` container,
  and user-written text gets `dir="auto"`. `docs/dev/i18n.md` has the whole picture.
- `bun run lint` checks the message files themselves (`eslint-plugin-i18n-json`, wired in
  `eslint.config.mjs`): every language carries every namespace of `messages/en` with the same
  key set, and each message parses as ICU. A key added to English alone fails CI. Angle
  brackets in a message are rich-text tags to next-intl — write `owner/repo`, not
  `<owner>/<repo>`, or the message does not parse.

`docs/dev/i18n.md` has the whole picture, including how a switch reaches the server render.

## Rules

- Prefer Server Components and server-side data fetching; reach for client components only for
  interactivity/hooks.
- A screen that has to stay live calls `useLiveRefresh({ scope, targets })` with a scope from
  `@/utils/revScopes` — never its own polling. `SyncProvider` polls every registered scope in one
  request and invalidates the targets of the ones that moved.
- **A paged list holds its window in `usePaging()` and renders `ListPager`.** The hook owns
  `page`/`pageSize`; a filter change calls its `reset()`, and `ListPager` pulls the page back
  when deleting rows leaves the reader past the end. Spread `paging.params` straight into the
  query — the API takes `page`/`pageSize` and answers `{ items, total, page, pageSize }`.
  A "show more" list reads the same route through `useInfiniteQuery` with
  `getNextPageParam: nextPageParam` (`useCompletedCyclesQuery` is the shape to copy); a feed
  reads a cursor route instead. A picker that needs every row calls the list's `/options`
  endpoint — never a paged one with a large `pageSize`.
- **The API client is split by domain.** `lib/api/core/` holds the transport —
  `client.ts` (`API_URL`, `request()`, `uploadFile()`, `ApiError`, `apiFailure`, the
  401 sign-out), `paging.ts` (`Page<T>`, `PageParams`, `pageQuery`, `nextPageParam`)
  and `media.ts` (`mediaUrl`). `lib/api/endpoints/` holds one flat file per domain,
  named after the module of `apps/api/src/modules` it calls: an endpoint on the API in
  `modules/cycles/` is reached from `lib/api/endpoints/cycles.ts`. A file keeps its
  DTOs next to the functions that return them, and exports both by name — there is no
  `index.ts` anywhere under `lib/api`, and no barrel re-exporting the domains. Types
  cross domains with `import type`, which the compiler erases, so a composite like
  `ProjectDetail` is assembled in the domain that owns the route without a runtime
  cycle. A moved type whose name matches a DOM global (`Permissions`, `Notification`,
  `Storage`) resolves to that global when its import is missing, so tsc stays silent
  while the type is wrong: import it explicitly.
- Call the backend over HTTP at the API origin. `lib/api/core/client.ts` takes it from
  `utils/runtimeEnv`, which reads `API_URL` in the server process and hands it to the
  browser through the inline script in `components/runtime-env-script.tsx`. A per-instance
  value goes through there — never `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` in a component, which
  `next build` inlines and which pins the image to one instance.
- Avatars and attachments render from `/media/...` on the web origin (`app/media`, which
  streams them from the api), not from an absolute api url. That keeps them local images
  for `next/image`: `images.remotePatterns` is frozen into the standalone build, so an
  api origin listed there would only be valid for the instance that built the image.
- **Every write to the API tells the user how it went.** A failed mutation is toasted by the
  `MutationCache` in `components/providers.tsx`, so a call site adds nothing for the failure;
  it adds the `toast.success(...)` for the success, from the mutation's `onSuccess`, with a
  translated message naming what was saved. A write whose result the screen already shows —
  a row that appears, a field that fills in, a dialog that closes on the created entity — needs
  no success toast; one whose effect is invisible does. A mutation that renders its own error
  instead opts out with `meta: { suppressErrorToast: true }`.
- **A reader gets values, not disabled controls.** When the current user may not change a
  setting, render its state — an icon plus a word, a plain row — instead of a switch, input,
  or button that is disabled. A disabled control reads the same whether it is off or merely
  locked. Say once, next to the setting, who can change it. And when a switch that gates a
  whole section is off, drop the section: the settings under it and the instructions that
  depend on them change nothing until it is on. One read-only state looks the same everywhere:
  the same icon and the same wording for on and off, in the row the control would have taken —
  reuse the component that already renders it rather than styling a second variant.
- Add shadcn components with `bunx shadcn@latest add <name>` (config in `components.json`).
- **Don't edit `src/components/ui/`** — those files are generated and re-adding a component
  overwrites them. Style them from the outside instead: every primitive carries a `data-slot`
  attribute, so a rule in `globals.css` targeting `[data-slot='…']` survives the update (the
  overlay shadows and the right-to-left corrections both work this way). Such a rule has to sit
  outside `@layer`: Tailwind orders its layers `theme, base, components, utilities`, so anything
  in `@layer components` loses to the utility classes on the element. When the change is a prop
  the component already exposes (`Sidebar side`), pass it from the caller rather than writing CSS.
  One prop reaches neither the caller nor CSS and has to be re-applied after a re-add:
  `chart.tsx` passes `debounce` to recharts' `ResponsiveContainer`, without which a chart in a
  container that resizes itself loops until React reports "Maximum update depth exceeded".
- Tailwind v4: no `tailwind.config`; tokens live in `src/app/globals.css` (`@theme`, CSS vars).
- Nothing per-instance may reach the bundle: the image is published once and serves every
  instance. New config of that kind belongs in `utils/runtimeEnv`.
- Don't remove `output: "standalone"` + `outputFileTracingRoot` from `next.config` — the Docker
  image depends on them.
- When touching `localStorage`/`window` in a render path (e.g. a `useState` initializer), guard
  with `typeof window === 'undefined'` — client components still server-render.
