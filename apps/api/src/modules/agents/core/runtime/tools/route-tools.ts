// The tools an internal agent uses to work in its project, built from the routes
// tagged with mcpTool() — the same table the MCP endpoint serves. A tool call is
// dispatched as an in-process request against the real route with the agent's API
// key, so the route's schema, permission guard, and error model apply unchanged.
// Nothing about an endpoint is restated here: this file only picks which routes an
// agent gets and binds them to its project.
//
// An agent's rights are therefore the intersection of two things: the actions it was
// granted (catalog.ts, stored in ai_agent.tools) and what its team role permits.
// A tool it holds but its role forbids returns the route's normal 403.

// Mastra accepts a JSON Schema wrapped in the ai-sdk schema protocol: an object
// carrying Symbol.for("vercel.ai.schema") alongside the raw schema. The symbol comes
// from the global registry, which is what lets an object built here be recognised by
// the ai-sdk copy bundled inside Mastra. Passing the route's schema through
// unconverted leaves the route's TypeBox definition as the only validator (`validate`
// is undefined, so nothing is checked before dispatch) — invalid model input reaches
// the route and comes back as its normal 400, which the model reads and retries.
// The cast is the seam between the two: Mastra accepts this object at runtime but
// types inputSchema as a Zod schema, and the arguments are a JSON object either way.
