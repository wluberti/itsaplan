// (ai_agent.user_id -> user.id): that user is what a work item is assigned to,
// what authors comments/activity, and what owns the agent's better-auth API key
// (apikey.reference_id).
//
// An agent belongs to a team and works in the projects of that team it is attached
// to; a project_member row is what says so, and one key therefore reaches every one
// of them. Both kinds of agent act through the same API under the same authorization:
// each owns an API key and project_member rows carrying its team role, so its requests
// are checked by the normal permission matrix. The kinds differ in who drives them:
// an external agent is driven over HTTP by its operator, who holds the key; an
// internal agent is driven by the built-in runtime, carries a model configuration,
// and replays its own key against the routes in process. That is why an internal
// agent's key is also kept here, encrypted — better-auth only stores a hash, and the
// runtime needs the secret on every tool call. An internal agent's effective rights
// are the intersection of its granted actions (ai_agent.tools) and its role.
