// Building a chart is one endpoint and nothing else: it checks a spec and answers
// with it. Nothing is stored — the chart lives in the answer the agent writes, in a
// ```chart fence holding the spec, which is what the chat draws in place (see the web
// app's markdownSegments). A tool call is shown as its own block, so a chart placed
// that way could not sit between two sentences; the fence can.
//
// The round trip is what makes the format one thing rather than three: this schema is
// the create_chart tool's arguments for an internal agent and an MCP client alike (see
// mcp/generate.ts), and a spec the model got wrong comes back as a 400 it can correct
// instead of a chart nobody can draw.
