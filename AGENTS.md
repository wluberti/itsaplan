# AGENTS.md

Bun + Turborepo monorepo. Backend **Elysia**, frontend **Next.js (SSR)** + **shadcn/ui**,
auth **better-auth**, ORM **Drizzle** + PostgreSQL. Self-hosted with Docker Compose;
Coolify is the deploy target of the reference instance.

Prefer the most specific `AGENTS.md` for the area being changed: every app and some packages
have their own, and it wins over this file. The `CLAUDE.md` next to it is a pointer, not a
second source.

## Core Coding Principles

**IMPORTANT — always follow, no exceptions:** Follow KISS and YAGNI. Write the simplest
thing that works, avoid premature abstractions, and don't add them until multiple concrete
implementations actually need them. No overengineering.

Before writing new code, study the existing codebase and follow its established patterns and
conventions when they are sound. Reuse existing shared modules, components, and utilities
instead of duplicating or reinventing them; extend what's there rather than adding parallel
solutions.

Write a minimum of comments. A comment explains why, the code explains what — cover a comment
with your hand and read the code under it: if the fact is recoverable from the code alone, the
comment does not belong there. A comment longer than the code under it is too long. A wrong
comment is worse than no comment, so change a comment in the same edit as the code it describes,
or delete it. The comment density of the code around a change is not a pattern to follow: this
rule wins over matching the neighbours. Layout and styling are never commented:
no notes on positioning, sticky or overflow behaviour, spacing, or why a class is set. The full
rules, and the pass that removes comments that no longer hold, are in the `tidy` skill.

## Writing style (docs, comments, chat)

Write plainly and literally. This applies to all prose: documentation, code comments, commit
messages, and chat replies.

- No metaphors, no personification, no figurative language. Do not write "the parser is the
  heart of the step", "data lives in Postgres", "self-healing queue", "the ticket flows through
  the pipeline". State the fact directly: "the parser is the main task of the step", "data is
  stored in Postgres", "a failed donor is retried on the next run".
- No rhetorical flourishes or dramatization. Describe what something does, not how important or
  elegant it is.
- Technical terms that happen to be metaphors in origin (watermark, backlog, queue, pipeline)
  are fine — they are standard terminology, not stylistic choices.
- Prefer short, direct sentences over expressive ones.

**Write the final state, not the edit history.** When the user changes a decision, rewrite
docs/comments to describe only the current design. Do not record the transformation of their
thinking.

- Do not write "not X, but Y", "now in the DB instead of in code", "decided", "moved from a
  separate step", "previously we planned". Just state Y.
- Do not annotate a choice with why it replaced an earlier idea from this conversation. The
  reader wants the current requirement, not how we got here.
- Forward-looking design rationale ("column `project_key` is added now so steps 3–4 need no
  migration") and cross-references between sections are fine — they explain the current design,
  not a discarded one.
- A discarded idea is only worth mentioning if it is a lasting "considered and rejected
  because…" that a future reader would otherwise re-propose — and then state it once, plainly,
  not as a correction to a prior draft.

## Golden rules

- **Runtime is Bun**, never npm/yarn/pnpm. Install with `bun install`, run scripts with `bun run`.
- **All code, comments, and strings are in English.**
- Cross-package imports use the workspace protocol: `"@repo/db": "workspace:*"`. Packages
  export raw `.ts` (see each package's `exports`) — Bun and Next transpile them, no build step.
- Run tasks from the **repo root** via Turborepo: `bun run dev` / `build` / `typecheck`.

## Layout

```
apps/api        Elysia (Bun) — mounts better-auth at /api/auth/*        :3000
apps/web        Next.js App Router, SSR (not SPA) + shadcn + TanStack Q :3001
apps/worker     webhook and notification delivery, agent runs, schedules
apps/bot        Telegram bot, long polling
packages/db     @repo/db     — Drizzle client, schema, migrations, permission matrix
packages/auth   @repo/auth   — better-auth server instance + instance auth settings
packages/crypto @repo/crypto — AES-256-GCM encryption for secrets at rest
packages/mailer @repo/mailer — SMTP/Resend transport for outbound email
packages/net    @repo/net    — SSRF guard for server-side fetches of a supplied URL
packages/agent-tools @repo/agent-tools — tool definitions for the AI agent runtime
packages/runner @itsaplan/runner — CLI that runs an external agent's queued tasks on the operator's own machine
packages/eslint-config @repo/eslint-config — shared ESLint config
```

Dependency graph: `api → @repo/auth → @repo/db`. **The web app never imports packages
directly** — it talks to the API over HTTP (better-auth client + fetch).

| `bun run db:migrate`      | apply migrations                                                 |

| `bun run setup`           | interactive setup: try it, develop, or generate env               |
| `bun run auth:generate`   | regenerate better-auth tables → `packages/db/src/schema/auth.ts` |

## First run

```bash
bun install
bun run setup   # pick "Develop" — see the table below
bun run dev     # api :3000 + web :3001
```

`bun run setup` (`scripts/setup.ts`, `@clack/prompts`) asks what to set up and does the rest:

| Answer | What it does |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Try it | generates the secrets, `docker compose up -d`, opens the localhost URL in the browser |
| Develop | `.env`, `apps/web/.env`, `.env.test`, dev compose, the `*_test` database, both migrations |
| Generate env | builds `.env` and `apps/web/.env` from the examples, walks every value, then writes both or prints them instead; starts nothing |

Self-hosting behind a domain is a manual `.env` and `docker compose up -d`, documented in
`docs/self-hosting.md` — the script only covers the local cases.

Running it again on a live instance does not damage it, and the rules that make that true
are the part to preserve when changing the script:

- Try it and Develop restart what is already up rather than setting up beside it, and each
  offers to stop the other: they read the same `.env`, so they publish the same api and web
  ports. Develop also offers to stop the PR stack, whose MinIO ports are fixed in its own
  compose file. A refusal ends the run and changes nothing.
- A busy port is offered for change, never forced. The check connects rather than binds, to
  `127.0.0.1` and `::1`: on macOS a bind on one loopback address succeeds beside a listener
  on the other, so a native Postgres and a container published on the wildcard both read as
  free.
- Postgres reads `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `POSTGRES_DB` once, when it
  initialises its volume, and the secrets are what the instance stored its data under. So a
  value is only generated while that volume does not exist, and one that already holds a
  real value is kept in every case. Generate env, which always produces a fresh set, asks a
  second time before it overwrites an existing `.env`.
- Both check that the running database accepts the credentials `.env` holds before starting
  the api, which would otherwise fail its healthcheck on the mismatch; a refusal is named,
  and `down -v` offered behind a confirmation that says the data goes with it. Develop also
  checks from the host that something answers on the Postgres port `.env` names — a
  container keeps the port it started with, so one that was not recreated publishes the old
  one and the migrations reach nothing.
- The setup migrates through `packages/db/src/migrate.ts`, not `bun run db:migrate`:
  drizzle-kit exits 1 without printing what the database refused.

## Environment

- Root `.env` (copy from `.env.example`) feeds api, drizzle, and docker-compose.
  Bun apps load it via `--env-file=../../.env`; drizzle via `dotenv` in `drizzle.config.ts`.
- `apps/web/.env` is **separate** — Next reads env only from its own folder. It holds
  `API_URL` (same value as the root one) and the legal document URLs. web reads them from
  its process at **startup**, never through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, which `next build` would inline
  into the bundle and pin the image to one instance.
- Local dev DB: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` (the deploy composes do
  NOT publish the DB port). Host 5432 is often taken; `bun run setup` finds a free port and
  writes both `POSTGRES_PORT` and `DATABASE_URL`.
- A new environment variable belongs in `.env.example` and, if a service needs it, in the
  compose files.

## Compose files

| File                         | Purpose                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker-compose.dev.yml`     | local backing services only: Postgres + MinIO. The apps run on the host.                                                                          |
| `docker-compose.yml`         | self-hosting stack. Runs the published images (`docker compose pull && up -d`) or builds them from source (`up -d --build`); reads a plain `.env`, requires the secrets via `${VAR:?}`. |
| `docker-compose.coolify.yml` | the same stack for Coolify: reads its generated `SERVICE_*` variables and builds from source. No `image:` here — with both fields Coolify still builds, and stops creating rollback images. |
| `docker-compose.coolify-images.yml` | the same stack as a Coolify service (New Resource → Docker Compose Empty): the published images, no `build:`, no `ports:`, and the two domains declared with `SERVICE_URL_API_3000` / `SERVICE_URL_WEB_3001`. |
| `docker-compose.test.yml`    | test gate against a throwaway Postgres.                                                                                                           |

A change to the deploy stack usually has to land in **all three** of `docker-compose.yml`,
`docker-compose.coolify.yml`, and `docker-compose.coolify-images.yml`. The **api applies migrations on startup** (`migrate.ts` in
its Dockerfile CMD), and dumps the database into the `db-backups` volume first — a failed
dump stops the startup, so nothing is migrated without a way back. `bot` runs Telegram long polling and must stay at one replica.

## Test gate (Docker)

`docker-compose.test.yml` runs the test suite against a throwaway Postgres, in a
container built from the same image as production. Integration tests need a live
database, so they cannot run during `docker build` — this compose file is the
mechanism instead. Build the images, then run the suite (non-zero exit on any
failing test):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm api-test
```

`run` starts api-test's dependencies (Postgres healthy, the MinIO bucket init
completed), runs the suite, and exits with its code. It does not use
`--abort-on-container-exit`, which tears the stack down the moment the one-shot
`minio-test-init` exits, before api-test starts.

The test database is created by the `postgres-test` service (`POSTGRES_DB=itsaplan_test`,
tmpfs — nothing persists). The `test` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs these
same commands.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request: `format:check` + `lint` +
`typecheck`, an app build, and the compose test gate. `codeql.yml` scans for security
issues. Do not add a workflow that duplicates a job an existing one already runs.

`publish-images.yml` pushes the four service images to GHCR
(`ghcr.io/croffasia/itsaplan-<service>`), one manifest per service covering amd64 and
arm64, each architecture built on a runner of its own. `release.yml` calls it once a
release is tagged: a `release: published` event raised by GITHUB_TOKEN starts no workflow
run, so the trigger has to be chained to the job that cut the release.

## Commits and releases

Versioning is automated by release-please (`release.yml`). It reads the
Conventional Commit subjects that land on `main` and keeps an open release PR
that accumulates the next version and `CHANGELOG.md`. Merging the release PR
tags the commit and publishes the GitHub Release. PR titles are squash-merged
into `main`, so the PR title is the commit subject release-please reads; it must
be a valid Conventional Commit (enforced by `pr-title.yml`).

The type in the subject picks the version bump, so pick it by what the change
gives the user, not by how much code it touches:

- **`feat:` — minor.** A capability that did not exist: a new entity, page,
  integration, or a setting that unlocks behaviour. Reserve it for what would
  earn a "Highlights" entry in the release notes.
- **`improvement:` — patch.** A visible change to something that already exists:
  a redesign, a reworked layout, a theme, an interaction that got better. Not a
  bug fix, not a new capability.
- **`fix:` — patch.** Behaviour that was wrong is now right.
- **everything else (`perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `build`, `ci`, `test`,
  `chore`, `revert`) — patch.**

The major is never automatic. While the version is `0.x`, `!` (e.g. `feat!:`)
bumps the minor (`bump-minor-pre-major`), and `1.0.0` is cut deliberately with a
`Release-As: 1.0.0` footer in the squash commit body. That footer overrides the
computed version for any release; release-please reads it before the versioning
strategy runs. After `1.0.0`, `!` bumps the major on its own.

`improvement` is not in the Conventional Commits standard list. release-please
bumps the patch for any type it does not recognise, and the entry reaches the
changelog because `changelog-sections` in `release-please-config.json` maps it to
an "Improvements" section — a type missing from that list is dropped from the
notes. Every type in that list gets its own section in the changelog, including
`chore` and `test`. The list of types a PR title may use lives in
`pr-title.yml`; the two have to stay in sync.

The scope is the name of one app or package (`api`, `web`, `worker`, `bot`, `db`,
`auth`, …). A change spanning several of them carries no scope.

`"package-name": ""` in `release-please-config.json` is what lets the release be
created at all. With `separate-pull-requests: false` release-please names the
release PR branch `release-please--branches--main`, without a component, while the
`node` release type otherwise derives the component from the `name` in the root
`package.json`. The two disagree, release-please skips the release, the merged PR
keeps its `autorelease: pending` label, and every later run stops at
`There are untagged, merged release PRs outstanding - aborting`. An empty package
name makes both sides resolve to no component. Tags stay `vX.Y.Z` — that is
`include-component-in-tag: false`, a separate setting.

Cutting a release also moves the `release` branch to the released commit, which
is what the deploy target follows. `main` stays the only branch anyone works in;
`release` is a mirror with a single writer, so it never needs a merge back. It
appears with the first published release.

**Agents do not commit.** Do the work, then write the proposed commit message in
chat as a Conventional Commit (`type(scope): summary`) for the user to run. Do
not call `git commit` or `git push` unless the user explicitly asks.

## Before pushing a branch (agents)

Run the changed code through two skills, in order:

1. `tidy` — simplify and refine: reuse, dead code, naming, altitude.
2. `code-review` — find bugs, security issues, and rule violations.

tidy first so review sees the final shape; a review before tidy goes stale when
tidy moves the code. This is separate from the CI gate (`format:check` + `lint` +
`typecheck`), which still must pass.

## Gotchas

- Don't add a build step for shared packages — they're consumed as source. The one
  exception is `packages/runner`: it is the only member published to npm, so it bundles
  to `dist/` (`bun build --target=node`) and its source stays free of Bun APIs — the
  published CLI runs on plain Node. Release it by hand (`npm publish` after bumping
  `version`); release-please manages the application's version, not this package's.
- When adding a new workspace member under `packages/*` or `apps/*`, add a matching
  `COPY <path>/package.json ./<path>/` line to every Dockerfile that installs deps
  (`apps/api`, `apps/web`, `apps/worker`, `apps/bot`). The install stage
  copies manifests by an explicit list, so a missing one fails
  `bun install --frozen-lockfile` in the Docker build with
  `Workspace dependency "@repo/<name>" not found`, even though local dev works.
- Changing the better-auth config in `packages/auth` may change its tables → run
  `bun run auth:generate` then `bun run db:generate` + `db:migrate`.
- Frontend and backend on different domains in prod: adjust cookie `sameSite`/`secure`
  and `APP_URL` (see `packages/auth/AGENTS.md`).
- Tests run on `bun test`. `apps/api` uses Eden Treaty; its setup and the rules for
  writing tests are in `apps/api/AGENTS.md`. They are integration tests against a real
  test Postgres (`.env.test`), not mocks. `packages/runner` has plain unit tests that
  need nothing running.
- `bun --filter` needs the `=` form: `bun --filter='@repo/db' run <script>`. The space form
  `bun --filter <name> run <script>` matches no packages in Bun 1.3.9.

Per-package details are in each package's `AGENTS.md`.

## Local deployment (this clone)

- `docker-compose.yml` stores all data in local bind mounts next to the repo:
  `./postgres-data`, `./minio-data`, `./db-backups`. There is no top-level
  `volumes:` block.
- Upstream PRs may (re)introduce named volumes. When reconciling a merge,
  convert any named volume back to a local bind mount (e.g.
  `db-backups:/backups` becomes `./db-backups:/backups`) and do not re-add the
  top-level `volumes:` block. Keep `docker-compose.coolify*.yml` as upstream
  ships them; the platform runs them, and they were never converted.
- The data directories are owned by the container users, so they are not
  readable by the host git user; ignore them in git rather than fixing the
  permission warnings.
